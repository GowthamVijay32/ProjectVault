        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Universe 25 is a laboratory experiment that was conducted by John B.
          Calhoun in the 1960s. The experiment was designed to study the
          behavior of mice in a controlled environment. It was aimed at creating
          a "mouse utopia" where the mice would thrive and reproduce without any
          restrictions. The results of the experiment have been debated and
          discussed for decades, and it remains a controversial topic among
          scientists.
        </p>

        <h2>The Experiment</h2>
        <p>
          The experiment involved creating a large enclosed environment that was
          designed to simulate a mouse utopia. The environment was divided into
          four main sections: living quarters, food storage, water supply, and a
          nesting area. The mice were free to move around the environment and
          were provided with everything they needed to survive.

        <h2 class="result-title">The Results</h2>
        <div class="result">
          <p class="result-text">
            Initially, the mice in Universe 25 thrived. They reproduced at an
            alarming rate, and the population grew rapidly. However, as the
            population grew, so did the problems. The living quarters became
            overcrowded, and the mice started to show signs of stress and
            aggression. They also began to exhibit abnormal behaviors such as
            cannibalism and infanticide. Eventually, the population started to
            decline, and by the end of the experiment, the mice had become
            extinct.

        <h2>The Implications</h2>
        <p>
          The results of the Universe 25 experiment have been used to study the
          effects of overpopulation and social isolation on animals, including
          humans. It has been suggested that the experiment can be used to
          explain the breakdown of social structures in human societies and the
          negative effects of overpopulation on the environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Universe 25 experiment remains a controversial topic in the
          scientific community. While some argue that the experiment can be used
          to study the effects of overpopulation and social isolation on
          animals, others have criticized the experiment for its lack of
          real-world applications. Regardless of the debate, the experiment has
          contributed to our understanding of social behavior and the impact of
          environment on animal populations.
